                            Every business has an origin story worth telling, and usually one that justifies why you do
                            business and have clients.

                            Some centennial enterprises have pages of content that can fit in this section, while
                            startups can tell the story of how the company was born, its challenges, and its vision for
                            the future.

                            Whatever it is, your story matters to your prospective buyers and team members. Make it
                            entertaining and as immersive as you can.
