<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br/> The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.<br/> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<br/[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <canvas> element, together with JavaScript.</p>
